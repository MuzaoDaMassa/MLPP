This is the Machine Learning Plus Plus Library.

A complete and all encompassing Machine Learning Library written entirely on C++.

A personal project that I began developing as a student, and hopefully will be useful to all AI C++ developers.

My intention is to develop this library into a single header file, facilitating integration into any project by any developer.

It will contain tools to help with Data Analysis and Processing, Linear and Logistic Regression Algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks, more to be added. 

Support with openCV or create new Video library to support Computer Vision is in the plans.
