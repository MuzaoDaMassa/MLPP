This is the Machine Learning Plus Plus Library.

A first attempt at a complete and all encompassing Machine Learning Library written entirely on C++.

A personal project that I developed for an autonomous car project I was doing at university. 

I decided to start from scratch in a second version which I'm currently working on so this version only has convolution neural network functionalities ready, since it was needed for the project mentioned previously.
